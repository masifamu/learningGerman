# Asking time:
**Wie spät ist es?** say this to ask time to someone, however its literal meaning is **how late we are?**
but it is used same like in english **what time is it?**.

# Telling Time:
The way we tell the time in german language differes and depends on the time. To make it more clear we will study
three ways to tell the time.

- when the time is exact at hours.

let say you want to say-**it is 10 o'clock.** then say-**Es ist zehn.**,and for **it is 4 o'clock.** say-**Es ist vier.**
  
- when the time is not exact at hours.

## Remeber:
when the minute leg of watch is between 12 and 6 through 1,2,3,4,5 then use "nach".

when the minute leg of watch is between 12 and 6 through 7,8,9,10,11 then use "vor".
           
Let say-**it is 08:05.** then simply say-**Es ist fünf nach acht.**
